## What is Binary Analysis?

Binary analysis is the process of examining executable files to understand their
structure, behavior, and implementation details without access to source code.
This is essential for:

- **Security Research:** Finding vulnerabilities and malware analysis
- **Software Engineering:** Understanding third-party libraries and legacy code
- **Performance Analysis:** Identifying optimization opportunities
- **Educational Purposes:** Learning how high-level code translates to machine code

## File Formats and Structure

### ELF Format (Linux)
Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) is the standard format for executables on Linux:

```bash
# Examine ELF header
readelf -h build/dskypoly

# View section headers
readelf -S build/dskypoly

# Display program headers
readelf -l build/dskypoly
```

### Key Sections
- **.text:** Executable code
- **.data:** Initialized data
- **.bss:** Uninitialized data
- **.rodata:** Read-only data (constants, strings)

## Hands-On Activity 1: Basic Binary Inspection

Let's examine the DSKYpoly polynomial solver binaries:

### Step 1: File Type Identification
```bash
cd /path/to/DSKYpoly
file build/dskypoly
file cubic/build/dskypoly3
file quartic/build/dskypoly4
```

**Question:** What differences do you notice between the binaries?

### Step 2: Size Analysis
```bash
ls -la build/dskypoly*
ls -la cubic/build/dskypoly3
ls -la quartic/build/dskypoly4
ls -la quintic/build/dskypoly5
```

**Question:** Why might different polynomial degree solvers have different sizes?

### Step 3: String Analysis
```bash
strings build/dskypoly | head -20
strings cubic/build/dskypoly3 | grep -i poly
```

**Question:** What mathematical terms can you identify in the strings?

## Hands-On Activity 2: Comparative Analysis

### Compare Binaries
```bash
# Compare file sizes
wc -c build/dskypoly cubic/build/dskypoly3 quartic/build/dskypoly4

# Compare string content
strings build/dskypoly > /tmp/dskypoly_strings.txt
strings cubic/build/dskypoly3 > /tmp/dskypoly3_strings.txt
diff /tmp/dskypoly_strings.txt /tmp/dskypoly3_strings.txt
```

### Dependencies Analysis
```bash
# Check library dependencies
ldd build/dskypoly
ldd cubic/build/dskypoly3

# Examine dynamic symbols
nm -D build/dskypoly
```

## Understanding Mathematical Software

DSKYpoly is perfect for learning binary analysis because:

1. **Clear Purpose:** Polynomial equation solving
2. **Mathematical Patterns:** Recognizable computational structures
3. **Progressive Complexity:** From quadratic to quintic solvers
4. **Assembly Integration:** Hand-optimized mathematical routines

## Assessment Questions

1. What is the difference between static and dynamic analysis?
2. How can you identify the entry point of a binary?
3. What sections would you expect to find mathematical constants in?
4. Why might a mathematical program use assembly language for core algorithms?

## Next Steps

Complete the hands-on activities above, then proceed to Lesson 2: Assembly Language Fundamentals.

## x86-64 Assembly Fundamentals

### Registers
Modern x86-64 processors have several register types:

**General Purpose Registers:**
- `rax`, `rbx`, `rcx`, `rdx` - Main data registers
- `rsi`, `rdi` - Source and destination index
- `rsp` - Stack pointer
- `rbp` - Base pointer (frame pointer)

**Floating Point Registers:**
- `xmm0`-`xmm15` - SSE registers for floating point
- `st(0)`-`st(7)` - x87 FPU stack registers

### Common Instructions

**Data Movement:**
```assembly
mov rax, rbx        ; Move value from rbx to rax (Intel syntax)
movss xmm0, [rsi]   ; Move single-precision float
movsd xmm1, [rdi]   ; Move double-precision float
```

**Arithmetic:**
```assembly
add rax, rbx        ; Integer addition (dst, src)
sub rax, rbx        ; Integer subtraction
imul rax, rbx       ; Integer multiplication
addss xmm0, xmm1    ; Single-precision float addition
mulsd xmm0, xmm1    ; Double-precision float multiplication
```

**Control Flow:**
```assembly
jmp label           ; Unconditional jump
je label            ; Jump if equal
jne label           ; Jump if not equal
call function       ; Function call
ret                 ; Return from function
```

## Hands-On Activity 1: Disassembly Analysis

### Step 1: Basic Disassembly
```bash
# Disassemble the main function with Intel syntax (more readable)
objdump -d -M intel build/dskypoly | grep -A 20 "<main>:"

# Disassemble with source if available
objdump -S -M intel build/dskypoly | head -50
```

### Step 2: Function Identification
```bash
# List all functions
objdump -t build/dskypoly | grep " F " | head -10

# Look for mathematical function names
objdump -t build/dskypoly | grep -i solve
objdump -t cubic/build/dskypoly3 | grep -i poly
```

### Step 3: Assembly Pattern Recognition

Look for these patterns in the disassembly:

**Function Prologue:**
```assembly
push rbp
mov rbp, rsp
sub rsp, 0x20       ; Allocate stack space
```

**Function Epilogue:**
```assembly
mov rsp, rbp
pop rbp
ret
```

**Mathematical Operations:**
```assembly
movsd xmm0, [rip+0x...]    ; Load floating point constant
mulsd xmm0, xmm1           ; Multiply doubles
addsd xmm0, [rbp-0x8]      ; Add memory operand
```

## Hands-On Activity 2: Mathematical Pattern Analysis

### Step 1: Analyze Polynomial Evaluation
```bash
# Focus on the solve_poly functions with Intel syntax
objdump -d -M intel build/dskypoly | grep -A 30 "solve_poly"
objdump -d -M intel cubic/build/dskypoly3 | grep -A 50 "solve_poly_3"
```

**Look for:**
- Floating point load instructions (`movsd`, `movss`)
- Mathematical operations (`mulsd`, `addsd`, `subsd`)
- Loop structures (`cmp`, `jl`, `jg`)
- Function calls to math library (`call`)

### Step 2: Compare Different Solvers
```bash
# Create disassembly files for comparison with Intel syntax
objdump -d -M intel build/dskypoly > /tmp/quadratic_disasm.txt
objdump -d -M intel cubic/build/dskypoly3 > /tmp/cubic_disasm.txt

# Compare the main solving functions
grep -A 20 "solve_poly" /tmp/quadratic_disasm.txt
grep -A 50 "solve_poly_3" /tmp/cubic_disasm.txt
```

**Analysis Questions:**
1. How does the complexity of assembly code change from quadratic to cubic?
2. What mathematical operations can you identify?
3. Are there any optimization patterns you notice?

## Understanding Calling Conventions

### System V ABI (Linux x86-64)
**Parameter Passing:**
- First 6 integer arguments: `rdi`, `rsi`, `rdx`, `rcx`, `r8`, `r9`
- First 8 floating point arguments: `xmm0`-`xmm7`
- Additional parameters on stack
- Return value in `rax` (integers) or `xmm0` (floats)

### Example Analysis
```bash
# Look for function calls and parameter passing
objdump -d build/dskypoly | grep -B 5 -A 5 "call.*printf"
```

## Hands-On Activity 3: Control Flow Analysis

### Step 1: Identify Loops
Look for patterns like:
```assembly
.L3:
    ; loop body
    add rax, 1          ; increment counter
    cmp rax, rbx        ; compare with limit
    jl .L3              ; jump back if less
```

### Step 2: Identify Conditional Logic
```assembly
cmp rax, rbx
je .L_equal             ; jump if equal
jg .L_greater           ; jump if greater
; default case code
```

### Step 3: Mathematical Algorithm Recognition

**Horner's Method Pattern (Intel Syntax):**
```assembly
; Computing ax^2 + bx + c as ((a*x) + b)*x + c
movsd xmm0, [coeff_a]   ; load coefficient a
mulsd xmm0, [x_value]   ; multiply by x
addsd xmm0, [coeff_b]   ; add coefficient b
mulsd xmm0, [x_value]   ; multiply by x again
addsd xmm0, [coeff_c]   ; add coefficient c
```

## Assessment Exercise

Analyze the main polynomial solving function in one of the DSKYpoly binaries:

1. **Function Identification:** Find the main solving function
2. **Parameter Analysis:** How many parameters does it take?
3. **Mathematical Operations:** Count floating point operations
4. **Control Flow:** Identify any loops or conditional branches
5. **Optimization:** Can you spot any optimization techniques?

Create a brief report documenting your findings.

## Tools Reference

**Basic Disassembly:**
```bash
objdump -d -M intel binary           # Disassemble all sections (Intel syntax)
objdump -d -j .text -M intel binary  # Disassemble only text section
objdump -S -M intel binary           # Include source if available
```

**Symbol Analysis:**
```bash
nm binary                   # List symbols
nm -D binary               # List dynamic symbols
readelf -s binary          # Detailed symbol information
```

**Advanced Analysis:**
```bash
gdb binary                 # Interactive debugger
(gdb) disassemble main     # Disassemble function in gdb
(gdb) info registers       # Show register contents
```
