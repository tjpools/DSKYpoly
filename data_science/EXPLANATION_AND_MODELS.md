The Role of Explanation in Data Science Models
=============================================

In data science, as in mathematics and engineering, the equations and algorithms are only part of the story. The true power of a model comes from the explanation that accompanies it: the context, the assumptions, the limitations, and the interpretation of results.

This is seen in:
- Differential equations describing physical systems (e.g., pump curves)
- Financial models like Black-Scholes
- Machine learning models and statistical inference

The Black-Scholes equation, for example, is not just a formula for option pricingâ€”it is a synthesis of stochastic calculus, market assumptions, and economic reasoning. Its value lies as much in the narrative and conceptual framework as in the mathematics itself.

The DSKYpoly project and this quintic solver app follow this tradition. By pairing computation with historical and conceptual context, we help users not just "get answers," but understand the landscape and meaning behind them. This approach is what makes mathematical tools truly educational and transformative.
