# DSKYpoly

> _“The machine does not think. It remembers, transforms, and reveals.”_

**DSKYpoly** is a symbolic performance system—a computational artifact shaped by the algebraic vision of Évariste Galois and the mechanical imagination of Babbage and Lovelace. It is not merely a program, but a meditation on solvability, structure, and the limits of symbolic expression.

Where modern platforms like YouTube and TikTok serve as proprietary stages for entertainment, DSKYpoly is a stage for symbolic constraint. It is a system that speaks in C and x86 assembly, but thinks in permutations, fields, and transformations.

## 🧠 Solvability and Symbolic Constraint

At the heart of DSKYpoly lies a question inherited from Galois:

> _What can be solved, and what must remain unsolved?_

Galois showed that the solvability of polynomial equations is not a matter of brute force, but of symmetry—of how the roots permute under transformation. His insight was that **structure determines solvability**. DSKYpoly adopts this principle not only in its algebraic inspiration, but in its architecture:

- The **Makefile** encodes symbolic rules of transformation
- The **log system** captures the evolution of state—like a Galois group tracking permutations
- The **codebase** is modular and introspective, reflecting the layered structure of solvable systems

DSKYpoly is not designed to solve all problems. It is designed to reveal the shape of solvability itself.

## 🧰 Project Overview

- Modular build system with diagnostic rules (`make doctor`, `make version`)
- Git-integrated version tracking and symbolic logging
- Written in C and x86 assembly for low-level transparency
- Inspired by algebraic theory, early computing, and symbolic logic
