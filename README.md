## üßÆ **Example: Quartic Polynomial**

**Input:** `x‚Å¥ - 10x¬≤ + 9 = 0`

**Ferrari's Method:**
1. Already depressed (no cubic term)
2. Resolvent cubic: `8t¬≥ - 80t¬≤ + 128t = 0`  
3. Solve cubic for auxiliary parameter
4. Extract quartic roots: `x = ¬±1, ¬±3`

**Assembly Implementation:**
```assembly
; 16-byte aligned coefficient storage
[rsp+0]   : 1.0    ; x‚Å¥ coefficient
[rsp+16]  : 0.0    ; x¬≥ coefficient  
[rsp+32]  : -10.0  ; x¬≤ coefficient
[rsp+48]  : 0.0    ; x¬π coefficient
[rsp+64]  : 9.0    ; constant term
```

## üî¨ **Example: Quintic Polynomial (5th Roots of Unity)**

**Input:** `x‚Åµ - 1 = 0`

**Hypergeometric Approach:**
1. Recognize as roots of unity: `exp(2œÄik/5)` for k = 0,1,2,3,4
2. Use hypergeometric functions to compute exact algebraic expressions
3. Extract numerical values with arbitrary precision
4. Visualize roots in complex plane

**Python Implementation:**
```python
solver = QuinticHypergeometricSolver()
roots = solver.solve_roots_of_unity(5)
# Returns: [1+0j, 0.309+0.951j, -0.809+0.588j, -0.809-0.588j, 0.309-0.951j]
```

## üåâ **The Abstraction Journey: From Silicon to Symmetry**

DSKYpoly represents more than just a polynomial solver‚Äîit's a meditation on the layers of abstraction that separate raw computation from mathematical truth. This project deliberately bridges multiple levels of the computational hierarchy:

### **Layer 1: Bare Metal Assembly**
At the foundation, we manipulate floating-point registers directly, crafting machine code that speaks to the silicon itself. Every coefficient placement, every stack alignment, every SSE instruction is a conscious choice about how mathematical concepts map to physical circuits.

### **Layer 2: Classical Algorithms**
Ferrari's quartic method and Cardano's cubic solutions encode centuries of mathematical insight into precise computational steps. These aren't mere calculations‚Äîthey're executable proofs of algebraic theorems.

### **Layer 3: Modern Numerical Methods**
The quintic solver introduces a hybrid approach, combining exact algebraic detection with numerical approximation. Here, we acknowledge both the power and limitations of symbolic computation.

### **Layer 4: High-Level Mathematical Abstraction**
The Python-based hypergeometric quintic solver operates in the realm of pure mathematical concepts‚Äîcomplex analysis, special functions, and symmetry groups. At this level, we're not just solving equations; we're exploring the deep structures that govern polynomial behavior.

### **The Philosophical Synthesis**
This multi-layered approach reveals something profound: **mathematical truth exists independently of its implementation**, yet the method of implementation shapes our understanding. The assembly code teaches us about computational constraints, while the high-level algorithms reveal mathematical patterns invisible at the machine level.

The project demonstrates that abstraction isn't about hiding complexity‚Äîit's about revealing different aspects of mathematical reality. Each layer offers unique insights:
- Assembly reveals the **computational cost** of mathematical operations
- Classical algorithms show the **historical development** of mathematical thought  
- Numerical methods expose the **practical limits** of exact computation
- High-level abstractions illuminate the **underlying mathematical structures**

This is why DSKYpoly maintains implementations at multiple levels: not for redundancy, but for **mathematical completeness**. Each layer is a different lens through which to view the same fundamental truths about polynomial equations.
