### 2. Cross-Platform Workflow (`cross_platform_workflow.py`)
Integration between Windows IDA and Linux Ghidra:

```python
from cross_platform_workflow import CrossPlatformAnalyzer

analyzer = CrossPlatformAnalyzer()

# Import IDA analysis from Windows
ida_results = analyzer.import_ida_analysis("binary_name", "ida_export.json")

# Run Ghidra analysis on Linux
ghidra_results = analyzer.run_ghidra_analysis("../build/dskypoly")

# Cross-validate findings
validation = analyzer.cross_validate_analysis("binary_name")

# Generate unified report
report = analyzer.generate_unified_report("binary_name", "html")
```

**Features:**
- IDA Pro analysis import and normalization
- Ghidra automated analysis execution
- Cross-tool validation and confidence assessment
- Unified reporting with disagreement analysis

framework = EducationalReversEngineeringFramework()

# Create complete curriculum
curriculum = framework.create_complete_curriculum()

# Track student progress
framework.track_student_progress("student_001", "lesson_01", 0.85)

# Generate progress report
report = framework.generate_progress_report("student_001")
```
