## 🎯 Overview

DSKYpoly has evolved from a pure polynomial solver into a comprehensive mathematical data science platform. This expansion leverages your existing mathematical foundation to tackle real-world data analysis challenges.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup Data Science Environment
```bash
# Create enhanced data science environment
conda env create -f environment_datascience.yml
conda activate dskypoly-datascience

# Or enhance existing environment
conda env update -f environment_datascience.yml
```

### 2. Run Financial Analysis Demo
```bash
# Quick financial analysis demonstration
python demo_financial_analysis.py

# For interactive Jupyter analysis
jupyter lab notebooks/DSKYpoly_DataScience_Showcase.ipynb
```

### 3. Explore the Toolkit
```python
from data_science.polynomial_toolkit import PolynomialAnalyzer, FinancialPolynomialAnalyzer

# Advanced polynomial regression
analyzer = PolynomialAnalyzer(max_degree=10, regularization='ridge')
analyzer.find_optimal_degree(X, y)
analyzer.plot_model_comparison(X, y)

# Financial time series analysis
fin_analyzer = FinancialPolynomialAnalyzer()
trend_analysis = fin_analyzer.analyze_price_trend(prices, dates)
```
