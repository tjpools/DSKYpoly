# DSKYpoly

*A mission console for algebraic exploration, built in x86-64 assembly.*
Inspired by the Apollo Guidance Computer's minimalist brilliance, **DSKYpoly** fuses the elegance of polynomial mathematics with raw precision of assembly language. Here, equations aren't just parsed-they're launched, classified, and solved through a symbolic 
interface modeled after the legendary DSKY: 'Verb/Noun' commamd sequences guide each stage of computation .

###🚀 Launch Instructions

Accecpt any degree-2 (quadratic polynomial and:
-**Parse** its coeffecients (the seed)
-**Solve** for its roots (the tree)
-**Display** real or complex results via a minimal 'Verb/Noun' interface

> Future phases will bring full support for cubic, quartic, and quintic expansions, unlocking deeper symmetry and strucure detection.
