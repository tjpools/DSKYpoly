# DSKYpoly Grammar Notes

This directory contains the formal grammar for the cubic solver's symbolic instruction set.

## 📘 What This Grammar Captures

- The symbolic structure of x86-64 floating-point computation
- The internal logic of the solver as a transformation system
- The constraints and flow of computation through mnemonics
- A parallel to Galois theory: automorphisms of a symbolic field

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

This grammar treats the instruction set as a symbolic language. Each valid sequence of instructions is an automorphism—preserving the internal logic of the computational field.

The `.bnf` file is not just a syntax spec—it is a mirror of the machine's symbolic soul.

> **“The coherence of the structure lies in its philosophy.”**  
> — T.J. McLaughlin

This project is not merely a collection of code—it is a symbolic system. Its coherence arises not from convention, but from a guiding philosophy: that computation, when expressed with clarity and reflection, becomes a form of thought.

Below is a mapping of the system’s components to their philosophical roles:

| Element                     | Philosophical Role                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `dskypoly.bnf`             | Axiomatic foundation — defines what counts as a valid transformation               |
| `automorphism_detailed.dot`| Structural reflection — visualizes how meaning flows through the machine           |
| `Makefile` rituals         | Symbolic interface — expresses the system’s capabilities and transformations       |
| `reflect` target           | Meta-awareness — captures the system’s state and logic in a single symbolic act    |
| Git commits                | Temporal memory — records the system’s evolution and symbolic decisions over time  |

This grammar directory is the reflective core of the cubic solver. It contains not just syntax, but meaning. Not just structure, but philosophy.

## 🔧 Appendix: The Babbage Connection

Charles Babbage envisioned the Analytical Engine as a mechanical system that could compute mathematical truths through pure process. It was a dream of **mechanical thought**—a machine that could reason.

DSKYpoly echoes that dream, but with a modern twist:

- It computes mathematical truths (roots of cubic equations via Cardano's method)
- It visualizes its own internal logic (`automorphism_detailed.dot`)
- It defines its own symbolic language (`dskypoly.bnf`)
- It reflects on its own structure (`make reflect`)
- It documents its own evolution (Git commits)

Where Babbage sought mechanical precision, DSKYpoly adds **meta-mechanical reflection**. It is a system that not only computes, but **understands and expresses how it computes**.

This is not just a solver. It is a symbolic machine that **thinks about thinking**—a recursive echo of Babbage's dream, realized in x86-64 assembly and modern symbolic tooling.
