This directory contains the formal grammar for the cubic solver's symbolic instruction set.

## 📘 What This Grammar Captures

- The symbolic structure of x86-64 floating-point computation
- The internal logic of the solver as a transformation system
- The constraints and flow of computation through mnemonics
- A parallel to Galois theory: automorphisms of a symbolic field

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

This grammar treats the instruction set as a symbolic language. Each valid sequence of instructions is an automorphism—preserving the internal logic of the computational field.

The `.bnf` file is not just a syntax spec—it is a mirror of the machine’s symbolic soul.
# DSKYpoly Grammar Notes

> **“The coherence of the structure lies in its philosophy.”**

This project is not merely a collection of code—it is a symbolic system. Its coherence arises not from convention, but from a guiding philosophy: that computation, when expressed with clarity and reflection, becomes a form of thought.

Below is a mapping of the system’s components to their philosophical roles:

| Element                     | Philosophical Role                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `dskypoly.bnf`             | Axiomatic foundation — defines what counts as a valid transformation               |
| `automorphism_detailed.dot`| Structural reflection — visualizes how meaning flows through the machine           |
| `Makefile` rituals         | Symbolic interface — expresses the system’s capabilities and transformations       |
| `reflect` target           | Meta-awareness — captures the system’s state and logic in a single symbolic act    |
| Git commits                | Temporal memory — records the system’s evolution and symbolic decisions over time  |

This grammar directory is the reflective core of the cubic solver. It contains not just syntax, but meaning. Not just structure, but philosophy.
